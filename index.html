  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Version control systems (VCS) are essential tools that help track changes in files—usually source code—over time. 
    They allow multiple people to collaborate on projects, keep a history of modifications, and revert to earlier versions when needed. 
    The field has evolved from simple centralized systems to distributed platforms that form the backbone of modern software development.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Purposes of Version Control</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Track every change made to a file or project.</li>
    <li>Enable collaboration among multiple developers.</li>
     <li>Maintain a detailed history of modifications and ownership.</li>
    <li>Allow rollbacks and branching for experimentation and safe updates.</li>
  </ul>

 <p>
    Modern VCS tools like Git integrate deeply into development workflows, enabling continuous integration, deployment automation, 
    and infrastructure management through concepts like GitOps.
