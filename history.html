  <h2>Historical Evolution</h2>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>1972 – SCCS:</strong> The Source Code Control System, developed at Bell Labs, introduced file change tracking on IBM mainframes.</li>
    <li><strong>1982 – RCS:</strong> Walter Tichy’s Revision Control System automated change tracking for individual files using delta storage.</li>
      <li><strong>1986 – CVS:</strong> Concurrent Versions System extended RCS for networked collaboration, enabling multi-developer projects.</li>
      <li><strong>2000 – Subversion (SVN):</strong> Created by CollabNet to improve CVS with atomic commits and better branching.</li>
     <li><strong>2005 – Git and Mercurial:</strong> Introduced distributed version control, giving each user a full repository copy.</li>
    <li><strong>2008 – GitHub:</strong> Brought social and cloud collaboration to version control, making Git widely accessible.</li>
   </ol>

   <h3>Centralized vs. Distributed</h3>
   <p>
    Early tools like RCS, CVS, and Subversion used a centralized model where a single server stored all code. 
    This created a single source of truth but also a single point of failure. 
    Distributed systems such as Git and Mercurial removed this limitation by giving each user a full local copy of the repository. 
    This allowed offline work, parallel development, and easier branching and merging.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Distributed VCS Changed Everything</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Developers can work offline and sync later.</li>
    <li>Branching and merging are fast and integral to workflows.</li>
    <li>Collaboration scales to thousands of contributors.</li>
  </ul>
