  <h2>GitOps and DevOps Integration</h2>
  <p>
    GitOps extends version control principles to infrastructure management. 
    It treats configuration and deployment scripts as code stored in Git, using pull requests and merges 
    to manage operational changes. Tools like ArgoCD and FluxCD automate deployments directly from Git repositories, 
    aligning DevOps practices with version-controlled automation.
  </p>

  <h2>Integration with CI/CD Pipelines</h2>
  <p>
    Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) rely on VCS as their foundation. 
    Every commit triggers automated builds, tests, and deployments, ensuring high-quality, 
    traceable releases. Systems like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI connect directly to repositories to automate this process.
  </p>

  <h2>Cloud Platforms and Collaboration</h2>
  <p>
    Cloud-hosted VCS platforms—GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket—combine repository hosting, project management, and CI/CD tools. 
    They enable social coding, issue tracking, and team collaboration, now central to modern software development.
  </p>

  <h2>AI in Code Management</h2>
  <p>
    Artificial intelligence is increasingly assisting with code reviews, merge conflict resolution, and predictive analysis. 
    Tools like GitHub Copilot and automated review bots help developers maintain quality and speed, 
    while machine learning models flag potential bugs or improvements before human review.
  </p>

  <h2>Real-World Example: Linux and Git</h2>
  <p>
    Git originated in 2005 when Linus Torvalds built it for the Linux kernel after losing access to BitKeeper. 
    Its design—distributed, fast, and resilient—enabled thousands of developers to collaborate effectively, 
    setting the standard for all modern version control systems.
